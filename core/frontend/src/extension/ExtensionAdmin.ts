 *   2. Download the needed files from
 *
 * 2 ways to load an Extension into the system:
 *
 *  1. At build-time provide the function to load both the Extension Manifest and import the main module of the extension.
 *     The main module must contain the activate() function.
 *  2. A minimum set of ExtensionLoaderProps that provide enough information to get the manifest
 *
 * An Extension can be in 3 different states:
 *   - Known
 *      - The Extension Admin has the minimal information needed to fetch the manifest for the Extension.
 *        knows the Extension exists but has not yet loaded the manifest
 *   - Installed
 *      - The Extension has the full manifest loaded and can be executed on the activation events
 *   - Disabled
 *      - The Extension has the full manifest but is not currently enabled and will not be executed based on the
 *        activation events.
